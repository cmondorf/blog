title: We need to discuss frustration in learning to code
subtitle: New post on Medium
---

I've recently published a post on Medium about a topic I think doesn't get the attention it deserves: [frustration when learning to code.](https://medium.com/@christianmondorf/we-need-to-talk-about-frustration-in-learning-to-code-980537f9299c)

A number of bootcamps, online courses and books do a good job of whipping up enthusiasm for how it's possible to transition into code from another background and how all you need is a computer and some time. What they fail to emphasize is how critical endurance and an ability to persist in the face of difficult problems is.
