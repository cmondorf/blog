title: Self-driving cars aren't cars
subtitle: New post on Medium
---


It's hard to know what self-driving cars will be like, but they won't be cars. The fact that we can only 
refer to them as such when discussing them says more about how heavily their legacy weighs on our psyche than it does about them.
That's the point I made in [a brief Medium post](https://medium.com/@christianmondorf/self-driving-cars-arent-cars-4d849085dd41) last year.
