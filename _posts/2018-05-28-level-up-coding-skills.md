title: You've learned the syntax, now level up your coding

So you've read a few books, followed a few tutorials, maybe attended a bootcamp. By now you should know the syntax pretty well, but to be able to work comfortably with a language or pass technical interviews you will need to build fluency in it. This is not unlike building virtuosity on a musical instrument, except in this case rather than practicing pieces of music you hack away at coding exercises. 

I list a few good places to go for such exercises on [How to build fluency in a programming language](https://medium.com/@christianmondorf/how-to-build-fluency-in-a-programming-language-3fdca65323c6), a new post up on my Medium account.
