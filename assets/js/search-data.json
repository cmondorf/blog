            "content": "So you’ve read a few books, followed a few tutorials, maybe attended a bootcamp. By now you should know the syntax pretty well, but to be able to work comfortably with a language or pass technical interviews you will need to build fluency in it. This is not unlike building virtuosity on a musical instrument, except in this case rather than practicing pieces of music you hack away at coding exercises. . I list a few good places to go for such exercises on How to build fluency in a programming language, a new post up on my Medium account. .",

A number of bootcamps, online courses and books do a good job of whipping up enthusiasm for how it’s possible to transition into code from another background and how all you need is a computer and some time. What they fail to emphasize is how critical endurance and an ability to persist in the face of difficult problems is. .",
